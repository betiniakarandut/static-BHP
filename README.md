# *_static-bhp_*

static-bhp is a Python package built using pandas library. It is distributed under license by MIT.

This package was created in NOVEMBER 2022.

# _description_
This package was created to help students overcome the tedious situation of reading and interpolating from graphs and tables. It can also be used to solve static bhp problems within the statedconditions in the oil and gas industry. It uses a python library called pandas. The static bottom hole pressure(bhp) calculator leverages the power of python pandas library providing an easy way to solve for the static bhp of a gas well with low and high pressure ranges using reduced temperatures between 1.5 to 1.7.
This package also utilizes the method of SUKKAR and CORNELL INTEGRAL to solve static BHP problems for natural gas systems.

# _installation_

Just like any other Python package, it can install by simply running the command below on your terminal or command prompt:

* **_pip install static-bhp_**

# dependencies

This package requires:

**_Python (>= 3.9)_**

**_numpy==1.23.2_**

**_pandas==1.4.3_**

# Using the package:
* First meet the requirements in the _dependencies_.
* Open your terminal or command prompt and pip install the package using the command **_pip install static-bhp_**.
* Import the package as follows:
	* _from static_bhp import static_bhp_
	* Fill in the data required
	* Read and follow the instructions carefully
	* Supply the values from the sukkar and cornell integral table provided
	* The static bottom hole pressure of the gas will be displayed after you have supplied all the data.
