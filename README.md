# *_static_bhp package_*

static_bhp is a Python package built using pandas library. It is distributed under license by MIT.

This package was created in SEPTEMBER 2022.

# _discription_
This package was created to help students overcome the tedious situation of reading and interpolating from graphs and tables. It can also be used to solve static bhp problems within the stated conditions in the oil and gas industry. It uses a python library called pandas. The static bottom hole pressure(bhp) calculator leverages the power of python pandas library providing an easy way to solve for the static bhp of a gas well with low and high pressure ranges using reduced temperatures between 1.5 to 1.7.
This package also utilizes the method of SUKKAR and CORNELL INTEGRAL to solve static BHP problems for natural gas systems.
